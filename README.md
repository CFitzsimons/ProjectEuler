ProjectEuler
============


The reason for doing these problems is to familiarise myself with C++ as a programming language.  Having studied Java for a year and a half prior to starting C++ I feel that I should be able to make a fair attempt at the problems and hopefully pick up some useful knowledge along the way.

The problems I am solving can be viewed at: http://projecteuler.net/problems 

If you notice any bad coding practices please don't hesitate to tell me, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn C++ and will take on board any constructive criticism.

A note on my commenting
=======================

All of my programs are commented with my name, the date of problem completion and the link to the question as purposed on Project Euler.  All methods from question 10 onwards should be readably commented and contain all relevent information.  However, if you see an improvement that could be made to the comment format please let me know.
