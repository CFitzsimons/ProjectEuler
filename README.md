ProjectEuler
============


The reason for doing these problems is to familiarise myself with C++ as a programming language.  Having studied Java for a year and a half prior to starting C++ I feel that I should be able to make a fair attempt at the problems and hopefully pick up some useful knowledge along the way.

The problems I am solving can be viewed at: http://projecteuler.net/problems 

If you notice any bad coding practices please don't hesitate to tell me, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn C++ and will take on board any constructive criticism.
